# Frost

Project Frost is a Combination of Science and Geo-Energy Generator Project, which maximizes from Home Resource Utilities including Wind Turbines and Soil Batteries, which thus converts the Elements into Voltages from Electrolytes and Wind. This was started as a Powerhouse Project in our Community to be able to gather Energy Sources without Nuclear Concepts or Independent from our Local Energy Company which sustains the Electricity in our House. I may not be a Scientists or a Physicists but rather a Tinker. I plan to turn our House into a Powerhouse which is a Mini Data Center for Storage Purposes and Free Internet Activism which adds up why I want to Build Antennas and Modems for Transmission / Receiving.
